  Group-Chat-NodeExpressIO
  Martin G. Puryear

========================

  Simple group chat application using NodeJS and ExpressIO.

  User is prompted for name and room. A single index.ejs view (and
style.css) displays all messages sent to that room.  Routes/route.js
handles the routing and essentially all the server-side code.  App.js
configures the express.io server appropriately.
